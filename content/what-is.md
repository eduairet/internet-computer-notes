# What is the Internet Computer?

-   The **Internet Computer** is a blockchain that runs decentralized apps at **web speed.**
-   It can **replace traditional IT** and enable a **new generation of Web3 apps and services.**

## The architecture of the IC

-   The IC runs on **nodes distributed globally in independent data centers.**
-   Nodes are grouped into **subnets,** forming their own blockchains.
-   Regular software and hardware updates ensure **rapid improvement and scalability.**

## The Network Nervous System governs the IC

-   The **Network Nervous System (NNS)** is the **decentralized source of truth** for the IC structure.
    -   Holds the ICP ledger.
    -   Tracks accounts and transactions.
    -   Allows token holders to stake and vote.
    -   Powers computation on the IC.
    -   Is a highly advanced decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

## Canisters are the next evolution of smart contracts

-   Canisters are **smart contracts bundled with a computer program and data.**
    -   Can be executed concurrently.
    -   Can communicate within and across subnets.
    -   Offers scalability.
    -   Can serve user interfaces.
    -   Can hold gigabytes of memory.
    -   Can pay for their own computation.

## Low-latency high-throughput consensus

-   The IC uses a **DAO-controlled network.**
    -   Low latency and high throughput consensus.
-   **Consensus** is reached within **1 to 2 seconds.**
    -   Can handle payloads in the order of megabytes.
-   The consensus **achieves cryptographic finality,** ensuring **irreversible state changes.**
-   The IC is **resilient to Byzantine faults**
    -   Can tolerate a certain number of faulty nodes.

## Chain-key cryptography underpins the IC's security architecture

-   **Chain-key cryptography authenticates** user requests, subnet states, and inter-subnet messages.
-   The NNS endorses subnet public keys, and users need the NNS's public key for validation.
-   Chain-key cryptography enables subnet membership changes, proactive security, permanent public keys, and garbage collection.
