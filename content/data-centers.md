# Decentralized Data Centers

-   The Internet Computer blockchain **combines computing resources from independently-operated data centers** worldwide.
-   Operates as a **public utility with decentralized governance.**
-   The architecture allows multiple computers to function as a powerful virtual machine.

## Subnets and Data Centers

-   **Nodes** in the Internet Computer:
    -   Are organized into subnet blockchains.
    -   Chain Key cryptography connects them.
-   Distributed architecture enables secure communication without vulnerable technologies like firewalls.
-   Node operators pay data centers to host their nodes and receive remuneration for contributing computing capacity.

## Physical Distribution and Decentralization

-   To ensure resilience against disruptions, blockchain subnet nodes are distributed across diverse data centers.
-   Nodes can be owned or provided by different parties in partnership with or unrelated to the data center locations.
-   Changes to the network topology are managed through the Network Nervous System (NNS), the blockchain's governance system.

## Node Providers and Data Center Operators

-   Node providers or their partner data center operators are responsible for monitoring and maintaining compute capacity.
-   They handle equipment repairs, replacements, and performance issues.
-   Network operations and upgrades are managed through the decentralized governance system, the Network Nervous System (NNS).
